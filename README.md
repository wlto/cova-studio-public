## Concept & Work

Cova Studio specializes in photography and videography for wedding events. Their value lies in providing customers with the best experience of their lives. To Cova, wedding is not just a big event but also a moment to be cherished and remembered forever. They want to tell stories of couples who have come so far in their journey to be together on wedding day.

Cova Studio has had many clients throughout the years with staffs over 12 years of experience. They are now ready for a revamp of their website which will help express their ideas and beliefs in wedding photography and drive in more customers. They are ready for the next adventure of their brands.

## Design

This project is part of many projects which I, William, is building as part of my portfolio. Hence, I am speed designing which means it does not include any wireframe or user story. It is mostly for quickly prototyping and testing out interface ideas that I have had in my mind for a while.

The design files can be found [here](./design/cova-studio.studio).

## Development

The goal of this project is for me to bring a bit of liveliness to the website. Instead of just a static site with stylings, I want to add animations where applicable that can better help convey the brand's message and create a positive emotional impact on the visitors of the website.

## Tools

- InVision Studio for UI and animation design.
- Sketch for quick logo (wordmark) design.
- VS Code for development.
- GatsbyJS + GSAP for front-end development.
- Vercel for static hosting.

## Copyright
